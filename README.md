# 05 Third-Party APIs: DayPlanner

This README has been generated to accompany the completed Day Planner application. The purpose of the Day Planner is to provide a simple calendar that allows users to save events for each hour of the work day. The saved data will remain in place even when the page is refreshed. Each event area changes color based on whether it is in the past, present, or future according to the user's local time zone. This application has been made responsive, ensuring it adapts to multiple screen sizes for broad usability. The goal of the Day Planner project was to become more familiar with dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, and to utilize the Moment.js library for manipulating dates and times.
